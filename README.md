# 25_Files
1. This bash file creates 25 new .txt files each time it is ran
2. The file names have are of the format "name-fn.txt" where "name" is the value given for the name variable and "fn" is the number evaluated by the script
3. The script creates a file named "last.txt" and stores the last number(fn) of the created files
4. When creating the files, the script checks the value in the last.txt file and proceeds from there to create the next 25 files
